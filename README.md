# Project Title - Cruise Ships 🚢

⚓️ Board the MCR Codes Cruise Ship 🛳for a round-the-world trip, visiting the world's most famous ports

Cruise Ships is great because it's made of Vanilla JavaScript and can go anywhere! 🏝

Users become the Captain 👩‍✈️👨‍✈️ of the Ship ⛴ and begin their journey by pressing the 'Set Sail' ⛵️ button. This will automatically plot a course 🌅 to the next port on the ships itinerary. 🚤 After every port has been reached users must disembark the cruise ship 🛥!

But don't worry - this is JavaScript 🤖: You can always refresh the page to embark on another trip! 🌍

## Tests

All the JavaScript is tested using Jest. To run the tests yourself you will need to open your terminal and install jest as a developer dependency by typing the following into the command line: `npm install -D jest`.

Once completed you will ne able to run the test by typing `npm test`.
